    Check whether the system events have already been registered to the handler variable.
    If not, then register an event range from EVENT.SYSTEM_SOUND to EVENT.SYSTEM_MINIMIZEEND,
        which will also include all the event inbetween those two (eg SYSTEM_CAPTURESTART).

    Note that the events will be deregistered once the returned handler object is destroyed,
        so we always need to store it in a variable, in this case the "handler" variable.
        Also it can't be a local variable, because local variables get destroyed after
        exiting the function/hotkey.
